# My Girlfriend's Tiger painted as Franz Marc's TIGER 
I am implementing the ideas from the 2015 paper
["A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by *Leon A. Gatys,
Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge*,
to paint my girlfriend's dog "Tiger" in the style that the artist Franz Marc used to paint a TIGER.
Below is a picture of "Tiger" (Shih Tzu).

The jupyter notebook contains everything. I used tensorflow to perform the neural style transfer. I recommend running it on a GPU (for instnace on google colab for free).
