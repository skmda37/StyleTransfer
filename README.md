# My Grilfriend's Tiger (Shih Tzu) painted as Franz Marc's TIGER (real tiger)
Here we are going to implement the ideas from the 2015 paper
["A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by *Leon A. Gatys,
Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge*,
and paint my girlfriend's dog "Tiger" as the artist Franz Marc might have done.
Below is a picture of "Tiger" (Shih Tzu).

Everything is found in the jupyter notebook. I used tensorflow to perform the neural style transfer. I recommend running it on a GPU for instnace on google colab for free. Have fun painting your own photograph in the style of your choice!
